Visual development artists design and develop the look and feel of feature films, animations, videos, and other types of productions. These artists may also work in advertising, publishing, marketing, or public relations. In the animation industry, visual development artists imagine and propose ideas for what the animated world should look like based on the story, characters, and action. Visual development artists also work with character emotions to help assist with the storytelling aspect of the animated production.

Visual development artists work with creative departments to develop backgrounds, colors, lighting, environments, and props for films, animated pieces and more. They use animation, illustration, drawing, and design skills to create visuals that convey ideas about how they envision the look of the piece. Visual development artists typically work in 2D or 3D and they use programs such as Photoshop and Maya. Visual development artists work in animation studios, film and video production studios, game design and development firms, and web design, graphic design and advertising and public relations firms. Visual development artists work in the rapidly growing mobile technology field as well.

The art and entertainment industry is one of the most competitive industries in the world. Because competition is so strong, most aspiring visual development artists opt for a bachelor’s or master’s degree in fine art, illustration, painting, animation, visual arts and communications, or other related field. These individual’s will also complete as many internships as possible or work in another support position to gain the valuable experience that just about every major employer requires. A bachelor’s degree and experience through an internship or other support position will help you obtain an entry-level position. For intermediate positions, a top studio or other employer may require a minimum of two years’ professional experience, plus a bachelor’s degree or higher. For upper level positions, employers may require an advanced degree, plus three to five years’ professional experience in the industry. For all levels, advanced knowledge of the latest industry software is a must.
